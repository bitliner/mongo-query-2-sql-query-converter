# mongo-query-2-sql

## Why?

* you are migrating to Cassandra, that requires queryies in CQL language - similar to CQL - but your queries are expressed according to MongoDb Query language
* you are using PostgreSQL to query MongoDB, and you don't want to create SQL-queries from scratch, but you want to translate the existing ones expressed in Mongodb Query Language
